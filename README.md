# TravelApplicationForm
The Travel Application Form is a Python-based program designed to streamline the process of gathering travel details from users. Utilizing Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI), users input their personal information such as name, phone number, and emergency contact, alongside travel specifics like source, destination, and travel date. Additionally, it offers meal preferences and payment mode options. Upon submission, the program calculates the total booking charges based on the distance between the chosen locations and displays it. The application seamlessly integrates with Excel, allowing for efficient storage of multiple travel entries in a structured manner for future reference and analysis. This versatile tool simplifies travel booking procedures while ensuring data organization and accessibility.
